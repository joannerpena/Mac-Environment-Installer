# DEV Environment Installer

**DISCLAIMER:** It is recommended to use this script with a Fresh installation of your MacOs System to avoid any random errors.

This script was created with the objective of installing everything you need for a development environment in your MacOs. From installing Brew for package downloading to Installing NPM packages for local usage.

## Still under development

Even though this script is fully functional as of now, I'm still working on the stability of it. So if you get any error or you have any recommendation of what you would like to see added in this script, do not hesitate in letting me know.
